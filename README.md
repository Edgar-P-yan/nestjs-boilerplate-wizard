# Nest.js Boilerplate Wizard
## Description

Helps to quickly and interactively spin up a work-ready boilerplate :D The main difference is that this is a wizard, which means that you can chose to include only those technologies that you really need, without overhead.

## Starting a new cool project with the Boilerplate Wizard

### Firstly, clone the template
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Edgar-P-yan/nestjs-boilerplate-wizard.git
```

### And run the **magic**
```bash
$ npm install
```
or
```bash
$ yarn
```
Then it will ask you what features do you want to enable in the boilerplate.

## List of currently available features:
 - **TypeORM** integration
 - ... stay tuned, there is gonna be more ;)

## Stay in touch
